# Immersive Travel - MWSE

A mod that adds real-time travel with smooth movement on striders, boats, ships, gondolas and river striders (with TR). The mod also has many quality of life features.

➡️ To start a trip talk to a Caravaner or Shipmaster and select the "Take me to..." dialogue option.

While on a mount you can freely move around the ships and river striders, or sit down and enjoy the trip.

- You always start a trip in a fixed slot
- The `W`, `A`, `D` keys let you move to different spots on the vehicle
- Pressing `S` lets you get up and freely move around the vehicle (only available on ships currently)
- Talk to the guide again to sit down in a slot

💡 Resting (default `T` key) while travelling lets you skip to the travel destination.
