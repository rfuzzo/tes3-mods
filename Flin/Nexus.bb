A mod that adds a real-time card game called "Flin".

‚û°Ô∏è To start speak to a random NPC about a "game of Flin". You need a deck of cards to play which you can get from a publican. After you settled for some money, you can start the game by placing down the deck and activating it.

üí° To view you hand and play a card you need to press a key (default `O` key)
üí° To head a trick, activate the card played by the NPC (or press the hand key again)

[color=#ff7700][size=4]Rules[/color][/size]

The rules are the same as¬†[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnapsen]Schnapsen (or sometimes called 66)[/url]
- Each player starts with a hand of 5
- Then players try to take tricks (trump or a higher value wins)
- If you win the trick, you get to go again and win the card values
- You win if you have 66 or more points

### Card values

- Unter: 2
- Ober: 3
- King: 4
- Ten: 10
- Ace: 11

### Phase 2

If the talon is used up, players must follow suit (Farbzwang) and win the trick if possible (Stichzwang) from this point onwards. You must:

- Head the trick with a higher card of the same suit.
- If unable to do so, they must discard a lower card of the same suit.
- If both above are not possible, they must head the trick with a trump.
- Only if they are unable to do the three above, they can discard a card of their choice.

üí° The mod makes this obvious by disabling certain cards in your hand to play

### Additional rules

- You can exchange the trump card for a trump Unter in your hand. That way you can get a more valuable card in your hand

üí° Activate the trump card to do so

- If you hold a King and Ober of the same suit, you may call it out: For a trump marriage, 40 points, For a non-trump marriage, 20 points.

üí° The mod displays an additional button in that case to press
